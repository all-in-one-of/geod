Geo.d
=====

A simple 3D geometry interchange format for moving to and from Houdini, Maya, and Blender.

This format and tool was concieved as a work aroung for shears not being properly transferred from Blender to Houdini via either Collada or FBX files. The on-disk representation of geometry is essentially a heirarchy of GEO files, and sidecar JSON files with metadata (including transformations).

This is active development, and very likely to change.
