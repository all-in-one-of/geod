- Blender:
    - bpy.ops.export_scene.obj(filepath=obj_out, use_selection=True)
        - without specifying axis, this exports blender's Z-up into Y-up
        - (..., axis_forward='-Z', axis_up='Y') seems Blender-native
        - exports into world space                   
    - bpy.context.selected_objects
    - obj.children -> other objects
    - obj.data -> a mesh
    - obj.matrix_world

    - Matrices are column-major instead of row-major; need to M.transposed()
      them to get them in the "right" order.

    - obj.matrix_local is the right one

    - obj.local is in the local directoins, but world units
    - obj.rotate is in local directions
    - obj.scale is in local directions, but world units

    - basis appears to be the local/rotate/scale, before the effects of parenting
